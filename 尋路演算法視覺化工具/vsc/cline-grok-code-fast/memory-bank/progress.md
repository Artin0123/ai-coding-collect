# Progress Log: Pathfinding Visualizer

## Completed Work
- [x] Initialized memory-bank/ directory
- [x] Created projectbrief.md with detailed requirements
- [x] Created activeContext.md for current state tracking
- [x] Set up basic project documentation structure
- [x] Created index.html file with complete implementation
- [x] Implemented 15x15 grid with proper CSS styling
- [x] Set up JavaScript grid data structures and state management
- [x] Implemented cell state management and rendering
- [x] Added mouse interaction for obstacle creation (click/drag)
- [x] Created control panel buttons and event handlers
- [x] Implemented algorithm selector functionality
- [x] Coded A* algorithm with Manhattan distance heuristic
- [x] Implemented Dijkstra algorithm
- [x] Added step-by-step animation with 10ms delays
- [x] Integrated statistics display (visited nodes, path length, time)
- [x] Added error handling for no-path scenarios

## Work In Progress
- [ ] Test grid interactions and algorithm correctness
- [ ] Verify animation timing and visual feedback
- [ ] Test edge cases (start/end at obstacles, no path, etc.)
- [ ] Open HTML file in browser for manual testing

## Known Issues
- Path animation only applies to closed nodes, might miss some optimal paths
- Dijkstra implementation uses same priority queue logic as A* (could be optimized)
- Algorithm selection toggles should work but need testing

## Environment Setup
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS implementation (no dependencies)
- Standard web browser compatibility assumed
- Project structure: index.html in root directory, memory-bank/ for documentation
